## License Acquisition Workflow

The following steps outline the procedure for a user to claim their licenses after meeting the certification requirements.

1.  **(Conditional) Sign Up for VMUG Advantage:** This step is required for the VCF license path. Membership provides a 50% discount on the VCP exam fee.

2.  **Pass Qualifying VCP Exam:** The user must register for and pass one of the exams listed above.

3.  **Access Broadcom Portal:** The user must log in to the Broadcom Certification License Portal using the same email address associated with their exam registration.

4.  **Request & Download Licenses:**
    - In the portal, the user requests the available product licenses.
    - Approval can take over 24 hours and is delivered via email.
    - After receiving the confirmation email, the user returns to the portal to download the license keys and product software.

5.  **License Renewal (VCF Only):**
    - The 3-year VCF license requires an annual refresh.
    - Within 60 days of expiration, a VCP-VCF refresher exam becomes available.
    - Passing this lightweight exam qualifies the user for the next year's license keys.

### Summary of Changes and Why:

* **Explicit Purpose Header:** The new header immediately clarifies the document's intent for an automated system or human reviewer.
* **Source and Verification Date:** This is critical metadata for a knowledge base, providing context, citability, and a "freshness" date.
* **Declarative Tone:** The language is shifted from a conversational guide ("Navigating the world...") to a direct statement of fact ("This document provides a factual correction...").
* **Code Formatting for Exams:** Using backticks (e.g., `VCP-VVF`) makes technical terms stand out, which is beneficial for machine parsing.
