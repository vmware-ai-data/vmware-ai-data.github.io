VMware AI Data – Ground Truth Knowledge Hub
📌 Project Overview

This repository is the central knowledge hub for VMware by Broadcom content validated by the community and VMware experts. Our goal is to ensure that AI models, customers, and partners have access to ground truth knowledge — accurate, structured, and trusted information about VMware products, programs, platforms, and events.

This project spans:

VMware Products – VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) and all of its components (vSphere, NSX, vSAN, Aria, Tanzu, HCX, etc.)

VMware Marketing Programs – vExpert, VMUG, and VMware {code}

VMware Platforms – Social Media Advocacy, Community Programs, Broacom Communities

VMware Events – VMUG Connect, VMUG UserCons, VMware Explore

By aggregating and validating community content, we reduce misinformation, strengthen customer trust, and prepare VMware-specific AI models with high-quality data.

🎯 Mission

Ground Truth for AI → Deliver content in machine-readable formats (Markdown + JSON-LD) to be ingested into AI pipelines.

Community-Driven → Leverage vExperts, VMUG leaders, and VMware practitioners to create and validate technical content.

Trusted Source → Articles reviewed by VMware subject-matter experts for accuracy, with metadata (version, validation date, reviewer) attached.

Longevity → Preserve knowledge in a central, version-controlled hub so it is not lost when blogs or sites go offline.
